# SlimmyAPI
A Simple API for unified acess to GitHub and GitLab APIs.

for testing try host/api/{user}/{repoName}

NB: github access might be forbidden in later cases due to quote limit aginst an ip (solution : use some proxy in m/c to bypass it) and for now i have not used access token.

Plan List for things to be done.

1> Async controller with exception handling @Advice and logging improvements.
2> On the fly customization using classloader.
3> Adhering to SOLID principle after refractering.
4> Pluggable API framework to be developed using runtime annotation thing.
